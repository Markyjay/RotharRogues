# Rothar Rogues


Picture


This website was designed to bring attention to a great community project called the Rother Rogues. Essentially a men’s shed on wheels that brings older men together by involving them in healthy based activities such as cycling and walking, local charity and travel excursions.

The website contains four pages Home, About, Gallery and Contact. The about page informs the user about the origin of the group and its various past activities and involvements. 

The gallery page is a collection mosaic of pictures of the current group and the contact page allow you to sign up to regular updates on events and meetings of the Rothar Rogues.

Users of the website will see the great things they have done and intend to do and also have the opportunity to get involved.

This project is the first of 5 projects that is required in order to receive my diploma in software development from the code institute.
The languages used to create the website are HTML5 and CSS3.

A live version of the site can be found here:

# UX

# User Demographic
This site is designed for those who would like to learn more about what mens shed groups do and are involved in. It will help those who wish to be involved or know those who would enjoy being involved to gain access to information about the groups events past and future.

# User Goals 
*	To encourage more people to get involved in community based projects that benefit the local people.
*	To advertise the great things that the group is involved in.
*	To display and record the groups activities and events.
*	To bring together a community of people to help them become connected and more active.

# Design
The design was inspired by the fact that my father is involved in the group and I noticed that they had very little if any advertisement about their events and activities. I believe it to be an invaluable asset to the local community and to men world wide. The aim was to create a similar design to the Love Running project in the course curriculum that incorporated many of the skills shown and taught in the program. The website has four pages all links included at the top in the header for each HTML page and at the bottom in the footer containing links to social media platforms.

# Color Scheme
<img src="/assets/images/Project 1 Palette.png" alt="Color palette"/>

The colour scheme I picked myself, I found them appealing to the eyes and relative to the Rothar Rogues logo and jackets they wear. They are consisting of;
*	A light shade for the subheading in the menu-bar
*	A shade darker than the above one for the text; 
*	A dark green shade for the headings;

# Topography
*	The fonts used for this project were from https://fonts.google.com/
*	Icons for the social media links from https://fontawesome.com/
*	The fonts used for the headings: font-family: 'Bree Serif', serif;
*	The fonts used for body: font-family: 'DM Serif Display', serif;


# Images
Images are a collection of pictures from the facebook page of the bulfin heritage cycle rally and the Instagram page of pedal vintage Durrow as well as other photos collected from the local whatsapp group. The purpose of the website is to give a friendly look and express quality. Images have been sized in order to match design and consistency.

# Header and Logo
<img src="/assets/images/Header\&\Logo.jpg" alt="Header & Logo"/>
This header consists of a logo designed by myself on Canva.com using a vintage bike template and old style text. The logo is placed to the left on the header and is also an anchor link to the Home page. 
The header contains the name of the group and their motto. it also anchors to the main index page and the style of circular edges was added to portray the running theme of wheels throughout the website.
