# Rothar Rogues


Picture


This website was designed to bring attention to a great community project called the Rother Rogues. Essentially a men’s shed on wheels that brings older men together by involving them in healthy based activities such as cycling and walking, local charity and travel excursions.

The website contains four pages Home, About, Gallery and Contact. The about page informs the user about the origin of the group and its various past activities and involvements. 

The gallery page is a collection mosaic of pictures of the current group and the contact page allow you to sign up to regular updates on events and meetings of the Rothar Rogues.

Users of the website will see the great things they have done and intend to do and also have the opportunity to get involved.

This project is the first of 5 projects that is required in order to receive my diploma in software development from the code institute.
The languages used to create the website are HTML5 and CSS3.

A live version of the site can be found here:

## UX

## User Demographic
This site is designed for those who would like to learn more about what mens shed groups do and are involved in. It will help those who wish to be involved or know those who would enjoy being involved to gain access to information about the groups events past and future.

## User Goals 
*	To encourage more people to get involved in community based projects that benefit the local people.
*	To advertise the great things that the group is involved in.
*	To display and record the groups activities and events.
*	To bring together a community of people to help them become connected and more active.

## Design
The design was inspired by the fact that my father is involved in the group and I noticed that they had very little if any advertisement about their events and activities. I believe it to be an invaluable asset to the local community and to men world wide. The aim was to create a similar design to the Love Running project in the course curriculum that incorporated many of the skills shown and taught in the program. The website has four pages all links included at the top in the header for each HTML page and at the bottom in the footer containing links to social media platforms. I used https://www.figma.com/ to achieve an overall perspective of how the site should look then incorporated various ideas and changes as the project took shape.

## Color Scheme
<img src="/documentation/project1palette.png" alt="Color palette"/>

The colour scheme I picked myself using the site https://coolors.co/, I found the blue shades appealing to the eyes and relative to the Rothar Rogues logo and jackets they wear. They are consisting of;

*	A light shade of lavender for the overall background.
* Tiffany blue for the heading background colour, footer and gallery background for most impact.
* Cambrigde blue for the navigation bar as well as the about and events section.
*	A basic gray for the text and in some cases a white depending on the background color.
*	Two other colors were chosen to help contrast certain sections and that is this color blue #0889EA
and this beautiful shade of red #f16c6b for the submit button and contact form highlighting 

## Topography
*	The fonts used for this project were from https://fonts.google.com/
*	Icons for the social media links from https://fontawesome.com/
*	The fonts used for the headings: font-family: 'Bree Serif', serif;
*	The fonts used for body: font-family: 'DM Serif Display', serif;

## Images
Images are a collection of pictures from the facebook page of the bulfin heritage cycle rally https://www.facebook.com/BulfinHeritageCycle/ and the Instagram page of pedal vintage Durrow https://www.instagram.com/pedalvintagedurrow/?hl=en as well as other photos collected from the local whatsapp group. The purpose of the website is to give a friendly look and express quality. Images have been sized in order to match design and consistency.

## Header and Logo
<img src="/documentation/headerandlogo.jpg" alt="Header & Logo"/>
This header consists of a logo designed by myself on https://www.canva.com/ using a vintage bike template and old style text. The logo is placed to the left on the header and is also an anchor link to the Home page. 
The header contains the name of the group and their motto. It also anchors to the main index page and the style of circular edges was added to portray the running theme of wheels throughout the website.


## Navigation Bar
<img src="/documentation/navigationbar.jpg" alt="Navigation Bar"/>

The navigation bar again has the circular edges and the cambridge blue was chosen as it stood out as a vintage color and contrasted the heading and logo very well. A white text was chosen to distinguish from the background. A text decoration of underline was applied to the active website page also. 

## Main Image
<img src="/documentation/mainimage.jpg" alt="Main image"/>

The main image was chosen for its colour and how it also capture the fun and camradierie of the the group, it contains the very relevent bikes that help the group stand out from other sheds and St. Patrick himself arrived to bless their congragation.

## Welcome section
<img src="/documentation/welcomesection.jpg" alt="Welcome"/>

The welcome section is a stand out paragraph to introduce the user to the focus of the group and it was worded by the groups organiser and creator Mr. Hugh Shepard.

## About page
<img src="/documentation/carousel.jpg" alt="Carousel"/>

The carousel was added to showcase my basic and recently learned knowledge of javascript in the hopes of practicing ahead of the following project with the code institute.

## Events Section
<img src="/documentation/eventssection.jpg" alt="Events Section"/>

The events section was to add a similar feature as found in the love running project and made a small information gallery on the past and future events that the group has and will be involved.

## Gallary
On my journey of discovery and learning of the new languages HTML and CSS i learned about CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid from websites such as W3C, codepen and youtube. I decided to used a very basic CSS Grid to showcase my ability in this gallery showing just 5 relevent pictures. As the group gathers more pictures the mosaic can grow and take shape.

## Deployment

The development platform used for this project was GitPod. To track the development stage and handle version control regular commits and pushes to GitHub has been conducted. The GitPod environment was created using a template provided by Code Institute.
The live version of the project is deployed at GitHub pages.
The procedure for deployment followed the "Creating your site" steps provided in GitHub Docs.
* Log into Github. 
* Select the correct GitHub Repository to be deployed live.
* Underneath the repository name, click the “Settings” option.
* In the sub-section list on the left, under “Code and automation”, click “Pages”.
* Within the ”Source” section choose ”main” as Branch and root as folder and click ”Save”.
* The page refreshes and a website shall then deploy via a link.

The live deployed link can be found here :
