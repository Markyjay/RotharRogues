# Rothar Rogues


Picture


This website was designed to bring attention to a great community project called the Rother Rogues. Essentially a men’s shed on wheels that brings older men together by involving them in healthy based activities such as cycling and walking, local charity and travel excursions.

The website contains four pages Home, About, Gallery and Contact. The about page informs the user about the origin of the group and its various past activities and involvements. 

The gallery page is a collection mosaic of pictures of the current group and the contact page allow you to sign up to regular updates on events and meetings of the Rothar Rogues.

Users of the website will see the great things they have done and intend to do and also have the opportunity to get involved.

This project is the first of 5 projects that is required in order to receive my diploma in software development from the code institute.
The languages used to create the website are HTML5 and CSS3.

A live version of the site can be found here:

## UX

## User Demographic
This site is designed for those who would like to learn more about what mens shed groups do and are involved in. It will help those who wish to be involved or know those who would enjoy being involved to gain access to information about the groups events past and future.

## User Goals 
*	To encourage more people to get involved in community based projects that benefit the local people.
*	To advertise the great things that the group is involved in.
*	To display and record the groups activities and events.
*	To bring together a community of people to help them become connected and more active.

## Design
The design was inspired by the fact that my father is involved in the group and I noticed that they had very little if any advertisement about their events and activities. I believe it to be an invaluable asset to the local community and to men world wide. The aim was to create a similar design to the Love Running project in the course curriculum that incorporated many of the skills shown and taught in the program. The website has four pages all links included at the top in the header for each HTML page and at the bottom in the footer containing links to social media platforms. I used https://www.figma.com/ to achieve an overall perspective of how the site should look then incorporated various ideas and changes as the project took shape.

## Color Scheme
<img src="/documentation/project1palette.png" alt="Color palette"/>

The colour scheme I picked myself using the site https://coolors.co/, I found the blue shades appealing to the eyes and relative to the Rothar Rogues logo and jackets they wear. They are consisting of;

*	A light shade of lavender for the overall background.
* Tiffany blue for the heading background colour, footer and gallery background for most impact.
* Cambrigde blue for the navigation bar as well as the about and events section.
*	A basic gray for the text and in some cases a white depending on the background color.
*	Two other colors were chosen to help contrast certain sections and that is this color blue #0889EA
and this beautiful shade of red #f16c6b for the submit button and contact form highlighting 

## Topography
*	The fonts used for this project were from https://fonts.google.com/
*	Icons for the social media links from https://fontawesome.com/
*	The fonts used for the headings: font-family: 'Bree Serif', serif;
*	The fonts used for body: font-family: 'DM Serif Display', serif;

## Images
Images are a collection of pictures from the facebook page of the bulfin heritage cycle rally https://www.facebook.com/BulfinHeritageCycle/ and the Instagram page of pedal vintage Durrow https://www.instagram.com/pedalvintagedurrow/?hl=en as well as other photos collected from the local whatsapp group. The purpose of the website is to give a friendly look and express quality. Images have been sized in order to match design and consistency.

## Features
*	Header and Logo
*	Navigation Bar
*	Main Image
*	Welcome Section
*	About Page
*	Events Section
*	Gallery Page
*	Footer
*	Contact page

## Header and Logo
<img src="/documentation/headerandlogo.jpg" alt="Header & Logo"/>
This header consists of a logo designed by myself on https://www.canva.com/ using a vintage bike template and old style text. The logo is placed to the left on the header and is also an anchor link to the Home page. 
The header contains the name of the group and their motto. It also anchors to the main index page and the style of circular edges was added to portray the running theme of wheels throughout the website.


## Navigation Bar
<img src="/documentation/navigationbar.jpg" alt="Navigation Bar"/>

The navigation bar again has the circular edges and the cambridge blue was chosen as it stood out as a vintage color and contrasted the heading and logo very well. A white text was chosen to distinguish from the background. A text decoration of underline was applied to the active website page also. 

## Main Image
<img src="/documentation/mainimage.jpg" alt="Main image"/>

The main image was chosen for its colour and how it also capture the fun and camradierie of the the group, it contains the very relevent bikes that help the group stand out from other sheds and St. Patrick himself arrived to bless their congragation.

## Welcome section
<img src="/documentation/welcomesection.jpg" alt="Welcome"/>

The welcome section is a stand out paragraph to introduce the user to the focus of the group and it was worded by the groups organiser and creator Mr. Hugh Shepard.

## About page
<img src="/documentation/carousel.jpg" alt="Carousel"/>

The carousel was added to showcase my basic and recently learned knowledge of javascript in the hopes of practicing ahead of the following project with the code institute.

## Events Section
<img src="/documentation/eventssection.jpg" alt="Events Section"/>

The events section was to add a similar feature as found in the love running project and made a small information gallery on the past and future events that the group has and will be involved.

## Gallary
On my journey of discovery and learning of the new languages HTML and CSS i learned about CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid from websites such as W3C, codepen and youtube. I decided to used a very basic CSS Grid to showcase my ability in this gallery conveying just 5 relevent pictures. As the group gathers more pictures the mosaic can grow and take shape.

## Footer
<img src="/documentation/footer.jpg" alt="Footer"/>

The footer consists of three sections, The main section contains the relevant social media links and are depicteded as interactive buttons with coinciding favicons to indicate the specific media. They also highlight when hovered over.
The second section floats left and has four useful links relevent to the group and its conception. The third section are links that help the user get involved in the various activities and programs that the rothar rogues are involved with.

## Contact Page 
<img src="/documentation/contactpage.jpg" alt="Contact"/>

To get regular updates and reviews of upcoming events and allow people the opportunity to get involved and join the group on excursions and events.

## Testing and bugs
Test has been conducted using Google Chrome, testing different devices and screen resolutions through google dev tools. 
Listed are the main bugs I came across.

1. The pictures gave me issues trying to get them the correct size. Especially for the responsive screen design.
 - Solution; find the best photos to fit the situation, for example in the gallery grid the first and fourth section needed portrait style pictures while sections 2 and 5 needed landscape orientated pictures.
 - The carousel was just a showcase of a little java script and the pictures were chosen for aestetic purpose rather than informational.
2. The youtube video and map were a bit problematic as well. The video on the Home page is very long and I couldn't manage to get it right.
 - Solution; have video in a separate div/section, or change the autofilled width and height that come with the link and amend in CSS.
3. The logo was a design of my own does not particularly fit with the design of the site, and i also used it as the favicon but it did not render correctly when shrinking to the size of the favicon.
 - Solution; Remove reviews.
4. The media queiries were my biggest issue. I did not realise the problems i would have by not considering the screen sizes from the beginning. I worked on a very large screen and after finishing the design i found that shrinking to phone size tended to change the overall aestetic of certain pages. The gallery did not look as proffesional on a phone as it did a desktop, and the header and logo were very difficult to keep aligned due to the use of float command. 
5. The first CW3 test pointed out a many errors but they were mostly the picture names had spaces. This is how i learned the best practice of no spaces no capitals. Other errors consisted of some irrelevant spaces and forward slashes, and a lot of media queiry conflicts.
 - Solution; remove the spaces from the picture name as well as any capital letters, remove irrelevant spaces and slashes, and review the media queiries to remove any conflicting elements.
6. Responsive design doesn't work well when sliding the screen to a smaller size. I felt i was only learning to understand media queiry toward the very end of the project and if i was to to it over again i would take responsivity more seriously from the beggining of the project. Using the devtools to choose each screen size helped alot but i was already so used to using the raw code to alter the design throughout the project.
 - Solution; I decided to use min-width for 1200px and above and the used old CSS generic screen sizes for below 1200px. 
 After many attempts i decided to do media query for max-width 480px then work back up to 1200px. It helped to start at the smaller screen size.
7. Resolution in the image on the contact page is still quite low but works somewhat well with the sign up form. The images in the gallery needed some tweeking to fitt in the various sections and the adare manor picture looks to be stretched horizontally but it was the angle that the photo was taken from.
 - Solution; Cropped certain pictures and chose pictures with better resolution.
